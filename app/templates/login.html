            <p class="light">
                Career Map is a project by a group of MIMS students to bridge the gap between intended future careers of iSchoolers and the selection of appropriate courses that will lead to them. We realise that course selection can be really hard, so we'd like to ease
                the process by collecting course ratings and reviews by current and past students.

            <h5 class="center">Why "Sign in with Linkedin"?</h5>
            <p class="light">
                We want to ensure the quality of the ratings and reviews. We believe that we can minimize bad behavior by ensuring that everyone's activities are tied to their professional identity on Linkedin.

                Yackle only accesses your profile information (name, title, profile pic, etc.) and email address. We don't do anything with your data other than simply display it to our members. We don't sell your data, or use it for targetting / ads etc.
