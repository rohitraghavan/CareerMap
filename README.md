# IRate ISchool

### Made by Rohit, Ed, Liz and Mudit

IRate ISchool is an application to bridge the gap between future careers of iSchoolers and courses relevant to those careers. We realize that course selection can be really hard, so we built an app were you can rate and review courses listed by career concentration.

### Uses:
1. FE: HTML/Materialize CSS/JQuery
2. BE: Flask Python framework
